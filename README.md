# Individual Project – Gun Control in the United States

## Problem Statement
The topic of gun violence is quite polarizing and the debate around it, intense for almost any person in the United States. A big reason why this is the case is because of the many different causes of violence committed with guns and the consequences of that for the victims, perpetrators, community, industry and the psyche of the nation as a whole. This means that there are a lot of variables involved in the process of buying guns, gun-related violence and outcomes in curbing that with gun control. 

**+	What does the literature tell you about the topic?**

The literature on the topic of gun control is quite extensive, but less so on the consequences of it towards reducing crime. This is because of the Dickey amendment passed by the United States Congress in 1996, which states that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.” There was a similar restriction put on the National Institutes of Health in 2011 (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/nih-quietly-shelves-gun-research-program, 2017)). Since they are the primary sources of health and safety research funding in universities and institutes, this funding freeze makes such research less likely to happen, compared to other causes of mortality (Stark & Shah, 2017).
The existing literature points towards the positive efficacy of gun control policies in bring down homicide rates and other related forms of gun violence. In Australia, a gun buyback program for assault-style weapons implemented following a mass shooting incident of 35 people in 1996 was correlated with a drop of 80% in gun suicides (Leigh & Neill, 2010). There have been no mass shootings since 2002, which was conducted without any assault weapons and had a death toll of only 2 people. On the other hand, with the existing gun control policies in the US, age-adjusted death rate from suicide by firearms was unchanged from 2013 to 2014. Another study pointed to the same conclusion -  that regulations that reduce overall gun availability has a significant deterrent effect on male suicides (Rodríguez Andrés & Hempstead, 2011).
On the other hand, there have been studies which also show that guns are desired for, and successively use in preventing crime. A couple of National Self-Defense Surveys performed in 1993 indicated that guns are used in self-defense over 2 million times per year (Kleck & Gertz, 1995). But by and large, research on the positive effects of gun ownership on crime and violence have been harder to come by.

**+	Where and why is the data product (in)effective?**

The data product by Vox – a series of 17 graphs, charts, maps and infographics, tries to deliver a comprehensive picture of gun violence: the factors contributing to it (mass prevalence of guns, lax gun control policies), effect on guns on fatality (world crime graph) and society (gun suicides, police fatalities), and finally, the attitudes towards gun control policies (post-mass shooting charts, Democrat-Republican lean towards specific policies). The story it tries to paint here through this article is that the overwhelmingly widespread prevalence of guns is correlated to the regular occurrence of mass shootings and gun-related deaths and suicides and the former in turn is related to the lax and hard-to-change gun control policies. It succeeds for the most part, because it provides simple, precise and to-the-point charts to justify the claims it makes. It is clever in using powerful but simple symbols as counts (human and gun silhouettes in graphics 1 and 2), the color red (graphics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 13), simple line, bar or pie charts (graphics 1, 7, 9-16) and everyday life visuals like maps and calendars (graphics 3, 4 and 8). In addition, most graphics are limited to one or two variables at a time. 
At the same time, the sheer number of graphics makes it too drawn out and as a result, capable of turning away less-invested or scientifically-minded people. Even though it tries to tell the story in an incremental manner, the diverse nature of the plots can result in the reader losing the thread of the article. Each plot is cited and linked to its source, but sometimes, they can be hard to follow through and reproduce. For the lay person, some of the plots may require a certain level of scientific attitude/mathematical education, which may again turn that person away, or worse, leave him/her to distrust it. Finally, for gun control skeptics, they could use any of these reasons, combined with mistakes made by Vox (they corrected graphic # 4 on 4/20/2018, 16 months after it was first published (www.facebook.com/Vox/posts/617292708458335, 2016).

**+	What is your proposal to redesign the data product?**

The most important thing to understand is who the audience is and what is the message that the data product is trying to convey. In this case, the audience is the people who read Vox, who happen to be left-leaning and more educated than the general American populace. As such, A lot of the points that the graphics are trying to make are already accepted by this audience. This is a catch-22 situation in that simplification will result in the article not being read much by the core audience, but over-complication resulting in turning off new converts. The goal of the data product, at the end of the day, is to try and convince more and more people about its message, and so I would advocate simplification over making it more tailored for the (already convinced) core audience. 
My first proposal would be to reduce the number of graphics so that the story can be more manageable. One way in which it can be done is by combining some of the plots which tell similar things (maybe 1 and 2) and leaving certain others out of the product (maybe 9 and 11). Some other graphics can be simplified or resized so that all of the critical information can be assimilated in one go (1, 4, 16 and 17). While the data product has used the color red effectively, it hasn’t used other colors and contrast as effectively (5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16), which is also something I would try to redesign. 


**+	What are potential starting points for a deceptive version and why are they deceptive?**

The high number of graphics means that there are many places where we could try to deceive the audience. Simpler bar and pie charts could be one such area where we could attempt that, as they are easy to adjust slightly to make the contrast appear bigger. Limiting the breadth of the data considered for a visual can tell a different picture altogether (taking only the period from 2000 to 2012 or 2015, because that shows a steady rise in percentage of people protecting gun rights, which could then be used to create paranoia about decreasing support for gun control). I would also try to use color to represent categories (bins) in such a way that they obscure the gradient of a quantity (in graph 8, for example, using only three colors instead of 5 could place most of the states with laws protecting children in the first bin, making the difference starker).

**+ Have you obtained access to the mentioned data sources or identified replacements/potentially important additions?**

I have obtained access to most of the data sources mentioned in the article. In addition to these, I also plan to use some other data for some of the graphics. For example, in combining graphics 1 and 2, having data about civilian-owned guns in the countries mentioned in 1 could help us contrast the message even better.
The sources from where I obtained data for the different visuals are given on the next page, in parentheses, after the title of each visuals.
 
1) America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and nearly 16 times as many as Germany (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chqUZHuY6cXYrRYkuE0uwXisGaYvr7durZHJhpLGycs/edit#gid=0)
2) America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world (same as 1)
3) There have been more than 1,600 mass shootings since Sandy Hook (http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls)
4) On average, there is around one mass shooting for each day in America (https://www.massshootingtracker.org/data/2015)
5) States with more guns have more gun deaths (http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2015/06/09/injuryprev-2015-041586.full, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/Firearm.htm)
6) It’s not just the US: Developed countries with more guns also have more gun deaths (https://web.archive.org/web/20170206100059/http://tewksburylab.org/blog/2012/12/gun-violence-and-gun-ownership-lets-look-at-the-data/)
7) America is an outlier when it comes to gun deaths, but not overall crime
8) States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths (https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/firearms-death-rate-per-100000/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)
9) Still, gun homicides (like all homicides) have declined over the past couple decades (https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcause.html)
10) Most gun deaths are suicides (https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html)
11) The states with the most guns report the most suicides (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0805923)
12) Guns allow people to kill themselves much more easily
13) Policies that limit access to guns have decreased suicides (http://ftp.iza.org/dp4995.pdf)
14) In states with more guns, more police officers are also killed on duty (https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302749)
15) Support for gun ownership has sharply increased since the early 2000s (http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/views-on-gun-policy/)
16) High-profile shootings don’t appear to lead to more support for gun control in the long term (http://www.people-press.org/2012/07/30/views-on-gun-laws-unchanged-after-aurora-shooting/)
17) Specific gun control policies are fairly popular (http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/views-on-gun-policy/)
